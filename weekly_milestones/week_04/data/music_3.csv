696,Måneskin,"vedo le case, da lontano, hanno chiuso le porte "
697,Måneskin,ma per fortuna ho la sua mano e le sue guance rosse 
698,Måneskin,lei mi ha raccolto da per terra coperto di spine 
699,Måneskin,coi morsi di mille serpenti fermo per le spire 
700,Måneskin,non ha ascoltato quei bastardi e il loro maledire 
701,Måneskin,con uno sguardo mi ha convinto a prendere e partire 
702,Måneskin,che questo è un viaggio che nessuno prima d'ora ha fatto 
703,Måneskin,"alice, le sue meraviglie e il cappellaio matto "
704,Måneskin,cammineremo per 'sta strada e non sarò mai stanco 
705,Måneskin,fino a che il tempo porterà sui tuoi capelli il bianco 
706,Måneskin,che mi è rimasto un foglio in mano e mezza sigaretta 
707,Måneskin,"restiamo un po' di tempo ancora, tanto non c'è fretta "
708,Måneskin,che c'ho una frase scritta in testa ma non l'ho mai detta

716,Måneskin,e il cielo piano piano qua diventa trasparente 
717,Måneskin,il sole illumina le debolezze della gente 
718,Måneskin,una lacrima salata bagna la mia guancia mentre 
719,Måneskin,lei con la mano mi accarezza in viso dolcemente 
720,Måneskin,col sangue sulle mani scalerò tutte le vette 
721,Måneskin,voglio arrivare dove l'occhio umano si interrompe 
722,Måneskin,per imparare a perdonare tutte le mie colpe 
723,Måneskin,"perché anche gli angeli, a volte, han paura della morte "
724,Måneskin,che mi è rimasto un foglio in mano e mezza sigaretta 
725,Måneskin,corriamo via da chi c'ha troppa sete di vendetta 
726,Måneskin,da questa terra ferma perché ormai la sento stretta
727,Måneskin,ieri ero quiete perché oggi sarò la tempesta

736,Måneskin,oggi mi sento benedetto e non trovo niente da aggiungere 
737,Måneskin,questa città si affaccerà quando ci vedrà giungere 
738,Måneskin,"ero in bilico tra l'essere vittima, essere giudice "
739,Måneskin,era un brivido che porta la luce dentro le tenebre 
740,Måneskin,"e ti libera da queste catene splendenti, lucide "
741,Måneskin,"ed il dubbio o no, se fossero morti oppure rinascite "

2038,Måneskin,tu portami dove sto a galla
2039,Måneskin,che qui mi manca l'aria
2040,Måneskin,"parla, la gente purtroppo parla"
2041,Måneskin,non sa di che cazzo parla
2042,Måneskin,tu portami dove sto a galla
2043,Måneskin,che qui mi manca l'aria
2044,Måneskin,ma sono fuori di testa ma diverso da loro
2045,Måneskin,e tu sei fuori di testa ma diversa da loro
2046,Måneskin,siamo fuori di testa ma diversi da loro
2047,Måneskin,"siamo fuori di testa ma diversi da loro, ah"
2048,Måneskin,noi siamo diversi da loro
2049,Måneskin,io c'ho vent'anni
2050,Måneskin,perciò non ti stupire se dal niente faccio drammi
2051,Måneskin,ho paura di lasciare al mondo soltanto denaro
2052,Måneskin,che il mio nome scompaia tra quelli di tutti gli altri
2053,Måneskin,ma c'ho solo vent'anni
2054,Måneskin,e già chiedo perdono per gli sbagli che ho commesso
2055,Måneskin,ma la strada è più dura quando stai puntando al cielo
2056,Måneskin,quindi scegli le cose che son davvero importanti
2057,Måneskin,"scegli amore o diamanti, demoni o santi"
2058,Måneskin,e sarai pronto per lottare
2059,Måneskin,oppure andrai via
2060,Måneskin,e darai la colpa agli altri
2061,Måneskin,o la colpa sarà tua
2062,Måneskin,correrai diretto al sole
2063,Måneskin,oppure verso il buio
2064,Måneskin,sarai pronto per lottare
2065,Måneskin,per cercare sempre la libertà
2066,Måneskin,e andare un passo più avanti
2067,Måneskin,essere sempre vero
2068,Måneskin,spiegare cos'è il colore
2069,Måneskin,a chi vede bianco e nero
2070,Måneskin,andare un passo più avanti
2071,Måneskin,essere sempre vero
2072,Måneskin,e prometti domani a tutti parlerai di me
2073,Måneskin,e anche se ho solo vent'anni dovrò correre
2074,Måneskin,io c'ho vent'anni
2075,Måneskin,"e non mi frega un cazzo, c'ho zero da dimostrarvi"
2076,Måneskin,non sono come voi che date l'anima al denaro
2077,Måneskin,"dagli occhi di chi è puro, siete soltanto codardi"
2078,Måneskin,e andare un passo più avanti
2079,Måneskin,essere sempre vero
2080,Måneskin,spiegare cos'è il colore
2081,Måneskin,a chi vede bianco e nero
2082,Måneskin,e andare un passo più avanti
2083,Måneskin,essere sempre vero
2084,Måneskin,e prometti domani a tutti parlerai di me
2085,Måneskin,e anche se ho solo vent'anni dovrò correre
2086,Måneskin,per me
2087,Måneskin,e sarai pronto per lottare
2088,Måneskin,oppure andrai
2089,Måneskin,e darai la colpa agli altri
2090,Måneskin,o la colpa sarà tua
2091,Måneskin,correrai diretto al sole
2092,Måneskin,oppure verso il buio
2093,Måneskin,sarai pronto per lottare
2094,Måneskin,per cercare sempre la libertà
2095,Måneskin,e c'hai vent'anni
2096,Måneskin,ti sto scrivendo adesso prima che sia troppo tardi
2097,Måneskin,e farà il male il dubbio di non essere nessuno
2098,Måneskin,sarai qualcuno se resterai diverso dagli altri
2099,Måneskin,ma c'hai solo vent'anni

2175,Måneskin,ci ho provato a liberarmi da quel senso di indesiderato
2176,Måneskin,ed ho fallito mille volte però ci ho provato
2177,Måneskin,ho messo pesi sulla schiena e poi sono caduto
2178,Måneskin,ho perso sangue dal naso e mi sono rialzato
2179,Måneskin,però a vent'anni già mi chiedo se son troppo stanco
2180,Måneskin,se quello che mi serve è quello che ho desiderato
2181,Måneskin,se un giorno riuscirò davvero ad esser realizzato
2182,Måneskin,e sono spaventato
2183,Måneskin,"e tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo"
2184,Måneskin,ho scelto sempre di essere uno ed uno soltanto
2185,Måneskin,toccare il cielo e ritornare a mangiare l'asfalto
2186,Måneskin,"a volte ho pianto, ma non è questo che mi ferma"
2187,Måneskin,voglio il mio riscatto
2188,Måneskin,"tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo"
2189,Måneskin,ho scelto di essere uno ed uno soltanto
2190,Måneskin,toccare il cielo e tornare a mangiare asfalto
2191,Måneskin,"in nome del padre, del figlio e spirito santo"
2192,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2193,Måneskin,"in nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2194,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2195,Måneskin,"in nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2196,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2197,Måneskin,"nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2198,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2199,Måneskin,"nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2200,Måneskin,"ehi, fate spazio, fatene tanto"
2201,Måneskin,"che adesso non mi basta il mondo, non mi basta il palco"
2202,Måneskin,"mi hanno chiamato in tutti i modi, anche codardo"
2203,Måneskin,"son morto più di cento volte, mai morto invano"
2204,Måneskin,"tu dimmi che stai nascondendo, cos'hai nel palmo?"
2205,Måneskin,perché dopo che mi hai guardato mi dai del pazzo?
2206,Måneskin,"se pensi che sono cambiato, che sono un altro"
2207,Måneskin,"non hai capito un cazzo di niente, quindi che cazzo mi guardi?"
2208,Måneskin,"tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, te lo ripeto"
2209,Måneskin,ho scelto di guardare più avanti di ciò che vedo
2210,Måneskin,"il mio passato non me lo scordo, non lo rinnego"
2211,Måneskin,"colpisci forte, tanto non cado, rimango in piedi"
2212,Måneskin,"tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo"
2213,Måneskin,ho scelto di essere uno ed uno soltanto
2214,Måneskin,toccare il cielo e tornare a mangiare asfalto
2215,Måneskin,"in nome del padre, del figlio e spirito santo"
2216,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2217,Måneskin,"nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2218,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2219,Måneskin,"nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2220,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2221,Måneskin,"nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2222,Måneskin,"ah, ah, ah, ehi"
2223,Måneskin,"nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2224,Måneskin,"ehi, per quello che ho vissuto, il tempo che ho buttato"
2225,Måneskin,pensavi che fossi morto e poi sono rinato
2226,Måneskin,di cos'è fare l'artista te ne hanno mai parlato?
2227,Måneskin,"di tutto quello che ho perso, che ho sacrificato"
2228,Måneskin,"di non avere voce, restare senza fiato"
2229,Måneskin,di avere mille persone che aspettano un tuo sbaglio
2230,Måneskin,sapere che ogni passo falso verrà condannato
2231,Måneskin,mi chiedo spesso se son stato solo fortunato
2232,Måneskin,e non mi passa il moto della mia rabbia
2233,Måneskin,spero che il mio passato se lo porti via la carta
2234,Måneskin,"è matto, questo è matto, chiedi perché lo faccio"
2235,Måneskin,"in nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo"
2236,Måneskin,ma dimmi le tue verità
2237,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2238,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2239,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2240,Måneskin,coraline coraline
2241,Måneskin,coraline bella come il sole
2242,Måneskin,guerriera dal cuore zelante
2243,Måneskin,capelli come rose rosse
2244,Måneskin,preziosi quei fili di rame amore portali da me
2245,Måneskin,se senti campane cantare
2246,Måneskin,vedrai coraline che piange
2247,Måneskin,che prende il dolore degli altri
2248,Måneskin,e poi lo porta dentro lei
2249,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2250,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2251,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2252,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline"
2253,Måneskin,però lei sa la verità
2254,Måneskin,non è per tutti andare avanti
2255,Måneskin,con il cuore che è diviso in due metà
2256,Måneskin,è freddo già
2257,Måneskin,è una bambina però sente
2258,Måneskin,come un peso e prima o poi si spezzerà
2259,Måneskin,"la gente dirà: ""non vale niente"""
2260,Måneskin,non riesce neanche a uscire da una misera porta
2261,Måneskin,"ma un giorno, una volta lei ci riuscirà"
2262,Måneskin,e ho detto a coraline che può crescere
2263,Måneskin,prendere le sue cose e poi partire
2264,Måneskin,ma sente un mostro che la tiene in gabbia
2265,Måneskin,che le ricopre la strada di mine
2266,Måneskin,e ho detto a coraline che può crescere
2267,Måneskin,prendere le sue cose e poi partire
2268,Måneskin,ma coraline non vuole mangiare no
2269,Måneskin,sì coraline vorrebbe sparire
2270,Måneskin,e coraline piange
2271,Måneskin,coraline ha l'ansia
2272,Måneskin,coraline vuole il mare ma ha paura dell'acqua
2273,Måneskin,e forse il mare è dentro di lei
2274,Måneskin,e ogni parola è un'ascia
2275,Måneskin,un taglio sulla schiena
2276,Måneskin,come una zattera che naviga
2277,Måneskin,in un fiume in piena
2278,Måneskin,"e forse il fiume è dentro di lei, di lei"
2279,Måneskin,sarò il fuoco ed il freddo
2280,Måneskin,riparo d'inverno
2281,Måneskin,sarò ciò che respiri
2282,Måneskin,capirò cosa hai dentro
2283,Måneskin,e sarò l'acqua da bere
2284,Måneskin,il significato del bene
2285,Måneskin,sarò anche un soldato
2286,Måneskin,o la luce di sera
2287,Måneskin,e in cambio non chiedo niente
2288,Måneskin,soltanto un sorriso
2289,Måneskin,ogni tua piccola lacrima è oceano sopra al mio viso
2290,Måneskin,e in cambio non chiedo niente
2291,Måneskin,solo un po' di tempo
2292,Måneskin,"sarò vessillo, scudo"
2293,Måneskin,o la tua spada d'argento e
2294,Måneskin,e coraline piange
2295,Måneskin,coraline ha l'ansia
2296,Måneskin,coraline vuole il mare
2297,Måneskin,ma ha paura dell'acqua
2298,Måneskin,e forse il mare è dentro di lei
2299,Måneskin,e ogni parola è un'ascia
2300,Måneskin,un taglio sulla schiena
2301,Måneskin,come una zattera che naviga
2302,Måneskin,in un fiume in piena
2303,Måneskin,"e forse il fiume è dentro di lei, di lei"
2304,Måneskin,e dimmi le tue verità
2305,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2306,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2307,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline, dimmi le tue verità"
2308,Måneskin,"coraline, coraline"
2309,Måneskin,"coraline, bella come il sole"
2310,Måneskin,ha perso il frutto del suo ventre
2311,Måneskin,non ha conosciuto l'amore
2312,Måneskin,ma un padre che di padre è niente
2313,Måneskin,le han detto in città c'è un castello
2314,Måneskin,con mura talmente potenti
2315,Måneskin,che se ci vai a vivere dentro
2316,Måneskin,non potrà colpirti più niente
2317,Måneskin,non potrà colpirti più niente
2318,Måneskin,"ehi calmati, ti ho detto, ""guardami"""
2319,Måneskin,è finito il tempo di nascondersi dietro quegli angoli
2320,Måneskin,adesso dimmi dove corri e perché ansimi
2321,Måneskin,non l'hai mai visto chi ha ballato coi fottuti diavoli
2322,Måneskin,chi è cresciuto a sogni forti e mani fragili
2323,Måneskin,"chi è stato spinto nella fossa, schiacciato ai margini"
2324,Måneskin,"coperto d'oro e poi trafitto, la bella kahlo frida"
2325,Måneskin,davanti a tutti stavo zitto e invece adesso guardami
2326,Måneskin,quindi tu resta con il tuo gruppo
2327,Måneskin,"striscia, prega, confonditi"
2328,Måneskin,"a noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi"
2329,Måneskin,siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti
2330,Måneskin,non ce ne frega un cazzo di te
2331,Måneskin,"e del tuo gruppo con cui mangi, strisci, preghi, vomiti"
2332,Måneskin,"a noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi"
2333,Måneskin,siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti
2334,Måneskin,non ce ne frega un cazzo di te
2335,Måneskin,"e del tuo gruppo con cui mangi, strisci, preghi, vomiti"
2336,Måneskin,"a noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi"
2337,Måneskin,siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti
2338,Måneskin,non ce ne frega un cazzo
2339,Måneskin,e se vuoi sapere la mia storia siediti ed ascolta
2340,Måneskin,dura una manciata di secondi quindi adesso contali
2341,Måneskin,voler brillare aver paura e tutti gli altri complici
2342,Måneskin,della paura di brillare che abbiamo da giovani
2343,Måneskin,è una bellissima morale ma da mezzi uomini
2344,Måneskin,una cultura secolare ma di stereotipi
2345,Måneskin,disprezza chi ha meno di te e quelli più in alto lodali
2346,Måneskin,onora tua madre e tuo padre ma da dietro sputagli
2347,Måneskin,"però mi resta la mia strada, gli sguardi, tre amici non codardi"
2348,Måneskin,e se il mondo l'ha capito adesso inizierà a guardarci
2349,Måneskin,e sono tanti gli stracci che ho preso senza lamentarmi
2350,Måneskin,"io sono zero, ma lo zero piscia in testa a te e il tuo gruppo"
2351,Måneskin,"striscia, prega, confonditi"
2352,Måneskin,"a noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi"
2353,Måneskin,siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti
2354,Måneskin,non ce ne frega un cazzo di te
2355,Måneskin,"e del tuo gruppo con cui mangi, strisci, preghi, vomiti"
2356,Måneskin,"a noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi"
2357,Måneskin,siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti
2358,Måneskin,non ce ne frega un cazzo di te
2359,Måneskin,e del tuo gruppo con cui mangi
2360,Måneskin,"ah sì, del tuo gruppo con cui mangi"
2361,Måneskin,"sì, del tuo gruppo con cui mangi"
2362,Måneskin,"sento mille voci che parlano, ma non sento che dicono"
2363,Måneskin,mi guardo allo specchio ed immagino di essere al circo
2364,Måneskin,su una giostra di felicità e non voglio andare giù
2365,Måneskin,anche se non mi diverto più
2366,Måneskin,a volte mi sento un miracolo e a volte ridicolo
2367,Måneskin,"poi perdo la testa in un attimo, ma non ditelo in giro"
2368,Måneskin,"son fuori di me, lai da ri ra rai"
2369,Måneskin,"son fuori di me, lai da ri ra rai"
2370,Måneskin,"e quindi prendimi, mordimi, toglimi tutto"
2371,Måneskin,continuerò a non avere la paura del buio
2372,Måneskin,anche quando sarò giù per terra distrutto
2373,Måneskin,continuerò a non avere la paura del buio
2374,Måneskin,"e quindi sputami, strappami i vestititi di dosso"
2375,Måneskin,continuerò a non avere la paura del buio
2376,Måneskin,"e quindi comprami, vendimi, fammi di tutto"
2377,Måneskin,sei soltanto tu ad avere la paura del buio
2378,Måneskin,noi no
2379,Måneskin,"noi no, io no, io"
2380,Måneskin,preparo il mio valzer col diavolo
2381,Måneskin,da quando son piccolo
2382,Måneskin,"puoi darmi del pazzo, bastardo, malato"
2383,Måneskin,io ci brinderò sopra col vino
2384,Måneskin,"sì, brinderò a te, lai da ri ra rai"
2385,Måneskin,"sì, brinderò a te perché so che anche se mi hai odiato"
2386,Måneskin,canterai il mio nome
2387,Måneskin,"e quindi prendimi, mordimi, toglimi tutto"
2388,Måneskin,continuerò a non avere la paura del buio
2389,Måneskin,anche quando sarò giù per terra distrutto
2390,Måneskin,continuerò a non avere la paura del buio
2391,Måneskin,"e quindi sputami, strappami i vestititi di dosso"
2392,Måneskin,continuerò a non avere la paura del buio
2393,Måneskin,"e quindi comprami, vendimi, fammi di tutto"
2394,Måneskin,sei soltanto tu ad avere la paura del buio
2395,Måneskin,noi no
2396,Måneskin,tu tornerai da me con l'aria stanca
2397,Måneskin,porterai i dettagli sulle braccia
2398,Måneskin,sei rimasta sola sulla barca
2399,Måneskin,riconosco i segni sulla faccia
2400,Måneskin,tu tornerai da me con le mani giunte
2401,Måneskin,tornerai da me
2402,Måneskin,tornerai da me con le mani giunte
2403,Måneskin,tornerai da me
2404,Måneskin,tornerai da me con le mani giunte
2405,Måneskin,tornerai da me

5721,Coldplay,the space in which we're traveling
5722,Coldplay,
5723,Coldplay,from the top of the first page
5724,Coldplay,to the end of the last day
5725,Coldplay,from the start in your own way
5726,Coldplay,you just want somebody listening to what you say
5727,Coldplay,it doesn't matter who you are
5728,Coldplay,
5729,Coldplay,under the surface trying to break through
5730,Coldplay,deciphering the codes in you
5731,Coldplay,"i need a compass, draw me a map"
5732,Coldplay,"i'm on the top, i can't get back"
5733,Coldplay,

5752,Coldplay,and if you come undone
5753,Coldplay,as if you've been run through
5754,Coldplay,some catapult it fired you
5755,Coldplay,you wonder if your chance will ever come
5756,Coldplay,or if you're stuck in square one
5757,Coldplay,what if there was no lie
5758,Coldplay,"nothing wrong, nothing right"
5759,Coldplay,what if there was no time
5760,Coldplay,"and no reason, or rhyme"
5761,Coldplay,what if you should decide
5762,Coldplay,that you don't want me there by your side
5763,Coldplay,that you don't want me there in your life
5764,Coldplay,what if i got it wrong
5765,Coldplay,and no poem or song
5766,Coldplay,could put right what i got wrong
5767,Coldplay,or make you feel i belong
5768,Coldplay,what if you should decide

5777,Coldplay,could be your biggest mistake
5778,Coldplay,it could bend or it could break
5779,Coldplay,that's the risk that you take
5780,Coldplay,what if you should decide
5781,Coldplay,that you don't want me there in your life
5782,Coldplay,that you don't want me there by your side
5783,Coldplay,oooooooh that's right
5784,Coldplay,let's take a breath try to put it aside

5787,Coldplay,ooooooh that's right
5788,Coldplay,when i was a young boy i tried to listen

5796,Coldplay,"part of a system, a plan"
5797,Coldplay,
5798,Coldplay,"all this noise, i'm waking up"

5807,Coldplay,in a permanent state
5808,Coldplay,
5809,Coldplay,maybe you'll know when you see it
5810,Coldplay,maybe if you say it you'll mean it
5811,Coldplay,and when you find it you'll keep it
5812,Coldplay,in a permanent state
5813,Coldplay,a permanent state
5814,Coldplay,
5815,Coldplay,when i was a young boy i tried to listen

5836,Coldplay,in a permanent state
5837,Coldplay,a permanent state
5838,Coldplay,
5839,Coldplay,swimming on a sea of faces
5840,Coldplay,a tide of the human race
5841,Coldplay,"so, an answer now is what i need"

5854,Coldplay,or a write a song nobody has sung
5855,Coldplay,or do something that's never been done
5856,Coldplay,are you lost or incomplete?
5857,Coldplay,"do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"
5858,Coldplay,"tell me, how do you feel?"
5859,Coldplay,"well, i feel like they're talking in a language i don't speak"
5860,Coldplay,and they're talking it to me
5861,Coldplay,so you take a picture of something you see
5862,Coldplay,in the future where will i be?
5863,Coldplay,you can climb a ladder up to the sun
5864,Coldplay,or write a song nobody has sung
5865,Coldplay,or do something that's never been done
5866,Coldplay,or do something that's never been done

5872,Coldplay,trying hard to speak and
5873,Coldplay,fighting with my weak hand
5874,Coldplay,driven to distraction
5875,Coldplay,it's all part of the plan
5876,Coldplay,when something is broken
5877,Coldplay,and you try to fix it
5878,Coldplay,trying to repair it

5894,Coldplay,and singing
5895,Coldplay,"ooh, ooh"

5910,Coldplay,"where to, where do i go?"
5911,Coldplay,"if you never try, then you'll never know."
5912,Coldplay,"how long do i have to climb,"
5913,Coldplay,up on the side of this mountain of mine? 
5914,Coldplay,"look up, i look up at night, "
5915,Coldplay,planets are moving at the speed of light. 
5916,Coldplay,"climb up, up in the trees, "
5917,Coldplay,"every chance that you get, "

5920,Coldplay,with my head stuck under the sand? 
5921,Coldplay,"i'll start before i can stop, "
5922,Coldplay,before i see things the right way up. 
5923,Coldplay,"all that noise, and all that sound, "
5924,Coldplay,all those places i have found. 
5925,Coldplay,"and birds go flying at the speed of sound, "
5926,Coldplay,to show you how it all began. 
5927,Coldplay,"birds came flying from the underground, "
5928,Coldplay,if you could see it then you'd understand? 
5929,Coldplay,"ideas that you'll never find, "
5930,Coldplay,all the inventors could never design. 
5931,Coldplay,"the buildings that you put up, "
5932,Coldplay,japan and china all lit up. 
5933,Coldplay,"the sign that i couldn't read, "
5934,Coldplay,"or a light that i couldn't see, "
5935,Coldplay,"some things you have to believe, "
5936,Coldplay,"but others are puzzles, puzzling me. "
5937,Coldplay,"all that noise, and all that sound, "
5938,Coldplay,all those places i have found.

5944,Coldplay,"all those signs, i knew what they meant."
5945,Coldplay,some things you can invent. 
5946,Coldplay,"some get made, and some get sent,"
5947,Coldplay,"birds go flying at the speed of sound, "
5948,Coldplay,to show you how it all began. 
5949,Coldplay,"birds came flying from the underground, "
5950,Coldplay,"if you could see it then you'd understand,"
5951,Coldplay,"ah, when you see it then you'll understand?"
5952,Coldplay,you see the world in black and white
5953,Coldplay,no color or life
5954,Coldplay,you think you'll never get it right
5955,Coldplay,"but you're wrong, you might"
5956,Coldplay,
5957,Coldplay,"the sky could fall, could fall on me"
5958,Coldplay,the parting of the seas
5959,Coldplay,"but you mean more, mean more to me"

5980,Coldplay,living in perfect symmetry
5981,Coldplay,nothing is as down or as up
5982,Coldplay,
5983,Coldplay,and don't you want to see it come soon
5984,Coldplay,floating in a big white balloon
5985,Coldplay,or given your own silver spoon
5986,Coldplay,
5987,Coldplay,don't you want to see it come down
5988,Coldplay,enough of throwing your arms around
5989,Coldplay,and saying not a moment too soon
5990,Coldplay,
5991,Coldplay,'cause i feel low

6296,Coldplay,from the rooftops i remember
6297,Coldplay,there was snow
6298,Coldplay,white snow
6299,Coldplay,clearly i remember
6300,Coldplay,from the windows they were watching
6301,Coldplay,while we froze down below
6302,Coldplay,when the future's architecture
6303,Coldplay,by a carnival of idiots on show
6304,Coldplay,you'd better lie low
6305,Coldplay,if you love me
6306,Coldplay,won't you let me know?
6307,Coldplay,was a long and dark december
6308,Coldplay,when the banks became cathedrals
6309,Coldplay,and the fog
6310,Coldplay,became god
6311,Coldplay,priests clutched onto bibles
6312,Coldplay,hollowed out to fit their rifles
6313,Coldplay,and the cross was held aloft
6314,Coldplay,bury me in armor
6315,Coldplay,when i'm dead and hit the ground
6316,Coldplay,my nerves are poles that unfroze
6317,Coldplay,if you love me
6318,Coldplay,won't you let me know?
6319,Coldplay,i don't want to be a soldier
6320,Coldplay,who the captain of some sinking ship
6321,Coldplay,would stow 
6322,Coldplay,far below
6323,Coldplay,so if you love me
6324,Coldplay,why'd you let me go?
6325,Coldplay,i took my love down to violet hill
6326,Coldplay,there we sat in snow
6327,Coldplay,all the time she was silent and still
6328,Coldplay,so if you love me
6329,Coldplay,won't you let me know?
6330,Coldplay,if you love me

6396,Coldplay,when she was just a girl
6397,Coldplay,she expected the world
6398,Coldplay,but it flew away from her reach

6622,Coldplay,but my heart is beating and my pulses start
6623,Coldplay,cathedrals in my heart
6624,Coldplay,"as we saw oh this light i swear you, emerge blinking into"
6625,Coldplay,to tell me it's alright

6689,Coldplay,"but that's all right, sometimes"
6690,Coldplay,the sunlight comes streaming through the holes
6691,Coldplay,somewhere up above the stars
6692,Coldplay,the wreckage of a universe floats past
6693,Coldplay,somewhere up above my heart
6694,Coldplay,a tiny little seed is sown
6695,Coldplay,a government is overthrown
6696,Coldplay,who knows when we'll be coming home at last
6697,Coldplay,and i heard it on the radio

6897,Coldplay,but i have no doubt
6898,Coldplay,"one day, we are gonna get out"
6899,Coldplay,tonight maybe we're gonna run
6900,Coldplay,dreaming of the osaka sun
6901,Coldplay,ohh ohh...
6902,Coldplay,dreaming of when the morning comes
6903,Coldplay,they are turning my head out
6904,Coldplay,to see what i'm all about
6905,Coldplay,keeping my head down
6906,Coldplay,to see what it feels like now
6907,Coldplay,but i have no doubt
6908,Coldplay,one day the sun will come out
6909,Coldplay,ooh...
6910,Coldplay,how long before i get in?
6911,Coldplay,"before it starts, before i begin? "
6912,Coldplay,how long before you decide? 
6913,Coldplay,before i know what it feels like? 
6914,Coldplay,"where to, where do i go?"
6915,Coldplay,"if you never try, then you'll never know"
6916,Coldplay,"how long do i have to climb,"
6917,Coldplay,up on the side of this mountain of mine? 
6918,Coldplay,
6919,Coldplay,"look up, i look up at night"
6920,Coldplay,planets are moving at the speed of light
6921,Coldplay,"climb up, up in the trees "
6922,Coldplay,every chance that you get
6923,Coldplay,is a chance you seize
6924,Coldplay,how long am i gonna stand
6925,Coldplay,with my head stuck under the sand? 
6926,Coldplay,i'll start before i can stop
6927,Coldplay,before i see things the right way up
6928,Coldplay,
6929,Coldplay,"all that noise, and all that sound"
6930,Coldplay,all those places i have found
6931,Coldplay,and birds go flying at the speed of sound
6932,Coldplay,to show you how it all began 
6933,Coldplay,birds came flying from the underground
6934,Coldplay,if you could see it then you'd understand? 
6935,Coldplay,
6936,Coldplay,ideas that you'll never find
6937,Coldplay,all the inventors could never design
6938,Coldplay,the buildings that you put up
6939,Coldplay,japan and china all lit up
6940,Coldplay,the sign that i couldn't read 
6941,Coldplay,or a light that i couldn't see
6942,Coldplay,some things you have to believe 
6943,Coldplay,"but others are puzzles, puzzling me"
6944,Coldplay,
6945,Coldplay,"all that noise, and all that sound"
6946,Coldplay,all those places i have found
6947,Coldplay,and birds go flying at the speed of sound
6948,Coldplay,to show you how it all began
6949,Coldplay,birds came flying from the underground 
6950,Coldplay,if you could see it then you'd understand 
6951,Coldplay,ah when you see it then you'll understand?
6952,Coldplay,
6953,Coldplay,"all those signs, i knew what they meant"
6954,Coldplay,some things you can invent
6955,Coldplay,"some get made, and some get sent"
6956,Coldplay,oh 
6957,Coldplay,birds go flying at the speed of sound
6958,Coldplay,to show you how it all began
6959,Coldplay,birds came flying from the underground
6960,Coldplay,if you could see it then you'd understand
6961,Coldplay,"ah, when you see it then you'll understand?"
6962,Coldplay,anything we should know about your change? 
6963,Coldplay,"they put the world in a tin can, "
6964,Coldplay,"black market, contraband, "
6965,Coldplay,"and it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it. "
6966,Coldplay,"in a long black trench coat, "
6967,Coldplay,"two hands around the throat, "
6968,Coldplay,ooh you want to get it right sometimes 
6969,Coldplay,
6970,Coldplay,"there's so much to be scared of, "
6971,Coldplay,"and not much to make sense of, "
6972,Coldplay,how did the clowns ever get control? 
6973,Coldplay,"if your hear can you let me know, "
6974,Coldplay,"how can they invade it, when it's so complicated? "
6975,Coldplay,ooh you just want to get it right sometimes 
6976,Coldplay,you just want to get it right sometimes 
6977,Coldplay,
6978,Coldplay,"that's how you see the world, "
6979,Coldplay,"how many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn, "
6980,Coldplay,"that's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself, "
6981,Coldplay,you're not gonna give up. 
6982,Coldplay,
6983,Coldplay,"and there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening, "
6984,Coldplay,"if you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful? "
6985,Coldplay,"we don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped "
6986,Coldplay,"ooh, we just want to get it right sometimes, "
6987,Coldplay,"just want to get it right sometimes, "
6988,Coldplay,
6989,Coldplay,"that's how you see the world, "
6990,Coldplay,"how many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word, "
6991,Coldplay,"that's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself, "
6992,Coldplay,'cause nobody can hurt you 
6993,Coldplay,
6994,Coldplay,that's how you see the world 
6995,Coldplay,that's how you see the world
6996,Coldplay,was a long and dark december
6997,Coldplay,from the rooftops i remember
6998,Coldplay,there was snow
6999,Coldplay,white snow
7000,Coldplay,
7001,Coldplay,clearly i remember
7002,Coldplay,from the windows they were watching
7003,Coldplay,while we froze down below
7004,Coldplay,
7005,Coldplay,when the future's architecture
7006,Coldplay,by a carnival of idiots on show
7007,Coldplay,you'd better lie low
7008,Coldplay,
7009,Coldplay,if you love me
7010,Coldplay,won't you let me know?
7011,Coldplay,
7012,Coldplay,was a long and dark december
7013,Coldplay,when the banks became cathedrals
7014,Coldplay,and the fog
7015,Coldplay,became god
7016,Coldplay,
7017,Coldplay,priests clutched onto bibles
7018,Coldplay,hollowed out to fit their rifles
7019,Coldplay,and the cross was held aloft
7020,Coldplay,
7021,Coldplay,bury me in armor
7022,Coldplay,when i'm dead and hit the ground
7023,Coldplay,my nerves are poles that unfroze
7024,Coldplay,
7025,Coldplay,if you love me
7026,Coldplay,won't you let me know?
7027,Coldplay,
7028,Coldplay,i don't want to be a soldier
7029,Coldplay,who the captain of some sinking ship
7030,Coldplay,would stow 
7031,Coldplay,far below
7032,Coldplay,
7033,Coldplay,so if you love me
7034,Coldplay,why'd you let me go?
7035,Coldplay,
7036,Coldplay,i took my love down to violet hill
7037,Coldplay,there we sat in snow
7038,Coldplay,all the time she was silent and still
7039,Coldplay,
7040,Coldplay,so if you love me
7041,Coldplay,won't you let me know?
7042,Coldplay,
7043,Coldplay,if you love me
7044,Coldplay,won't you let me know?
7045,Coldplay,scared of losing all the time
7046,Coldplay,he wrote it in a letter
7047,Coldplay,he was a friend of mine
7048,Coldplay,he heard you could see your future
7049,Coldplay,inside a glass of water
7050,Coldplay,with ripples and the rhymes
7051,Coldplay,he asked will i see heaven in mine?
7052,Coldplay,
7053,Coldplay,oh that is just the way it was
7054,Coldplay,and nothing could be better
7055,Coldplay,and nothing ever was
7056,Coldplay,and they say you can see your future
7057,Coldplay,inside a glass of water
7058,Coldplay,with riddles and the rhymes
7059,Coldplay,but will i see heaven in mine?
7060,Coldplay,"oh, oh, oh"
7061,Coldplay,
7062,Coldplay,"son, don't ask,"
7063,Coldplay,neither how full nor empty is your glass
7064,Coldplay,cling to the mast
7065,Coldplay,spend your whole life living in the past
7066,Coldplay,going nowhere fast
7067,Coldplay,
7068,Coldplay,so he wrote it on a wall
7069,Coldplay,the hollowest of halos
7070,Coldplay,is no halo at all
7071,Coldplay,and televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
7072,Coldplay,saying nothing at all
7073,Coldplay,and you chime
7074,Coldplay,stars in heaven align
7075,Coldplay,oh
7076,Coldplay,
7077,Coldplay,"son, don't ask,"
7078,Coldplay,neither how full nor empty is your glass
7079,Coldplay,cling to the mast
7080,Coldplay,spend your whole life living in the past
7081,Coldplay,going nowhere fast
7082,Coldplay,
7083,Coldplay,"what are we drinking when we're done, just glasses of water"
7084,Coldplay,then there was rain
7085,Coldplay,the sky wore a veil of gold and gray
7086,Coldplay,at night it was the bright of the moon with me
7087,Coldplay,time was just floating
7088,Coldplay,then there was rain
7089,Coldplay,this town's foundations are crumbling
7090,Coldplay,to the ground comes a bit of a tumbling
7091,Coldplay,and time just floated away
7092,Coldplay,we can watch it and stay and we can listen
7093,Coldplay,"oh, rainy day, come round"
7094,Coldplay,sometimes i just want it to slow down
7095,Coldplay,and we're separated now
7096,Coldplay,i'm down
7097,Coldplay,but i love it when you come over to the house
7098,Coldplay,i love it when you come over to my house
7099,Coldplay,then there was rain
7100,Coldplay,and i spent the night with the queen of spain
7101,Coldplay,my lonely little heart would've broke again
7102,Coldplay,times were vicious
7103,Coldplay,"singing, deeper that the knife goes in the more you win"
7104,Coldplay,you win but with less than when you begin
7105,Coldplay,deeper that the knife goes in
7106,Coldplay,oooooooooooooooh
7107,Coldplay,"ooh, rainy day come round"
7108,Coldplay,sometimes i just want it to slow down
7109,Coldplay,we're separated now
7110,Coldplay,i'm down
7111,Coldplay,but i love it when you come over to the house
7112,Coldplay,i love it when you come over to my house
7113,Coldplay,aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah

7117,Coldplay,i love it when you come over to my house
7118,Coldplay,but i love it when you come over to the house
7119,Coldplay,i love it when you come over to my house
7120,Coldplay,smoke is rising from the houses
7121,Coldplay,people burying their dead
7122,Coldplay,i ask somebody what the time is
7123,Coldplay,but time doesn't matter to them yet
7124,Coldplay,
7125,Coldplay,people talking without speaking
7126,Coldplay,trying to take what they can get
7127,Coldplay,i ask you if you remember
7128,Coldplay,"propekt, how could i forget?"
7129,Coldplay,
7130,Coldplay,drums
7131,Coldplay,here it comes
7132,Coldplay,"don't you wish that life could be as simple,"
7133,Coldplay,as fish swimming round in a barrel.
7134,Coldplay,when you've got the gun?
7135,Coldplay,
7136,Coldplay,oh and i'll run
7137,Coldplay,here it comes
7138,Coldplay,we're just two little figures in a soup bowl
7139,Coldplay,trying to get the anaconda control
7140,Coldplay,when i wasn't one
7141,Coldplay,
7142,Coldplay,here i lie
7143,Coldplay,on my own in a separate sky
7144,Coldplay,here i lie
7145,Coldplay,on my own in a separate sky
7146,Coldplay,i don't want to die
7147,Coldplay,"on my own, here, tonight"
7148,Coldplay,here i lie
7149,Coldplay,on my own in a separate sky
7150,Coldplay,just because i'm losing
7151,Coldplay,doesn't mean i'm lost
7152,Coldplay,doesn't mean i'll stop
7153,Coldplay,doesn't mean i will cross
7154,Coldplay,
7155,Coldplay,just because i'm hurting
7156,Coldplay,doesn't mean i'm hurt
7157,Coldplay,doesn't mean i didn't get what i deserve
7158,Coldplay,no better and no worse
7159,Coldplay,
7160,Coldplay,i just got lost
7161,Coldplay,every river that i've tried to cross
7162,Coldplay,and every door i ever tried was locked
7163,Coldplay,"oh, and i'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off."

7166,Coldplay,in a little pond
7167,Coldplay,doesn't mean you've won
7168,Coldplay,'cause along may come

7170,Coldplay,and you'll be lost
7171,Coldplay,
7172,Coldplay,every river that you tried to cross
7173,Coldplay,every gun you ever held went off
7174,Coldplay,"oh, and i'm just waiting 'till the firing starts"
7175,Coldplay,"oh, and i'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off"
7176,Coldplay,"oh, and i'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off"
